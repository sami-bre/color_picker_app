# color_picker_app
A flutter -  android/iphone app that web / GUI programmers can use to get the hex value of a color of their choice

I named the app 'Color picker'

This repository contains the 'assets' and the 'lib' android studio project files (so that anyone interested could build the app on their machine)
as well as the complete release version of the app for android. (so that anyone can install it on their device and have some fun :)

I apologize beforehand for lack of annotation in the code in the 'main.dart' file.
